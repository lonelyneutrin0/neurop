## About neurop 
`neurop` is a Python package implementing [Neural Operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_operators#:~:text=Neural%20operators%20directly%20learn%20operators,be%20evaluated%20at%20any%20discretization.), which are a class of operating learning models. The package currently supports the following operator architectures -
- Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)
- Deep Operator Network (DeepONet)
- Complex Neural Operator (CoNO)

## Usage
`neurop` is published on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/neurop/) and can be installed using `pip` - 
```
pip install neurop
```

## License
`neurop` is available under the MIT License.

## Attribution
